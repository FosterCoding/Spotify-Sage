## How to Use
1. Run `Redirect.py` FIRST to handle authentication.
2. Run `SpotifySage` to generate your custom Spotify stats report.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Originally made because I tried to use Stats for Spotify and my Spotify account was hacked not too long after. I assumed that the StatsForSpotify app had a data leak. (Slippery Slope fallacy I know). I figured I can do the same thing with Python while also getting to work on a fun project as well.

SpotifySage is a Python-based tool to analyze your Spotify listening habits and create reports similar to Spotify's year-end review.

2.0 - Version 2.0 is released and solves that pesky ENV problem I had. The script saves the auth locally!! Theoretically, this means anybody should be able to download and use it.
For detailed notes, please refer to CHANGELOG.
