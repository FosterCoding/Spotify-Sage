Current Version:
 1.0 - Base working bot. Basic PDF extraction. Does not work without ENV files containing Client ID and Secret just yet.
 Updated main function to grab auth code form access_token.txt instead of trying to enter it manually.
 Updated callback under Redirect to save code to access_token.txt.
 Changed PDF Extraction to be a numbered list.
 Will create Spotify_Stats.pdf under the root directory of Spotify Sage
